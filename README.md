# Sawtooth Healthcare
_Sawtooth Healthcare_ is a blockchain application built on Hyperledger
Sawtooth, allowing clinics to keep history regarding petients health on the 
blockchain. The repo is based on two other repos available on the internet:

https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-marketplace
https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/tree/master/sdk/examples/xo_python

This repo consists of certain components. Some of them are ready to use:

- a **transaction processor** which handles Healthcare transaction logic
- a **CLI** client to work with the application
- a **unit** and **functional regression** tests

some of them to be accomplished later:

- a **rest api** which provides HTTP/JSON endpoints for querying blockchain data
- a **shell** with all of the dependencies necessary to run support scripts
- **load tests** to stress/load the application and measure performance etc
- **Kubernates** configuration to scale the network
